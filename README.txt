# Application of the Convolutional Neural Network Architecture for Image Classification using Custom Created Images Composed of Digitally Drawn Digits 

*The provided python files in the ZIP will allow you to run the code that I developed which trains and tests on data. The Training script is called "CNNTrainingscript_ShijirB.py" and the Testing script is called "CNNTestingscript_ShijirB.py". 

*The data needed is also included in the ZIP file which is comprised of 1000 digitally drawn digits from ImageJ program in TIF file format with 830 of them belonging in the "TrainingData" Folder and 170 belonging in the "TestingData" Folder with the corresponding subfolders of the classes. 

*Also included in the ZIP file is the saved trained model called "trainedmodel_ShijirB.h5" which achieved 97% training accuracy using the same parameters in the "CNNTrainingscript_ShijirB.py".

*To run the training or testing script file use the command "python CNNTrainingscript_ShijirB.py" in command line or "python CNNTestingscript_ShijirB.py" and ensure that you are in the correct directory using CD. 

**Make sure that all the files included in the ZIP folder are in the same and proper path or directory of your computer for it to work properly.** 

*These are the packages and versions of it from my computer that I used to develop the project:

-Anaconda: Custom (64-bit)
